# `06` Lambda functions in Python

A **lambda function** is a function with just one line of code and no name.

It is a very special type of funcion in the world of python because you can use it as a small utility for very agile coding:

```python
# declaring a normal funcion for multiplication
def multiply(p1, p2):
    return p1 * p2

# declaring it now like a one line lambda
multiply = lambda p1,p2: p1 * p2
```
:point_uo:Facts:

+ **Lambda fuctions** have to be always very small.

+ **Lambda function** can only have one line.

+ **Lambda function** don't need a `return` statement (it is assumed that it will return whatever is on that one line).

+ **Lambda functions** can be stored in variables or passed as parameters to another function

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a variable called `is_odd`.

2. Assign a **lambda function** to it that returns `True` or `False` if a given number is odd.

## 💡Hint

+ Here is how you would declare it like a normal function:

```py
# this function return True if a number is odd.
def is_odd(num):
    return num % 2 != 0
```

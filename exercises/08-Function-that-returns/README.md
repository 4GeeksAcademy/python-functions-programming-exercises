# `08` Functions that return


Is a very good practice that all functions return something, even if it is "null" if your functions return something you can then create algorithms that use several functions at the same time. For example, in this particular case we have two functions available:

dollarToEuro: that calculates the value in euros of a given value in dollars.
autoToYen: calculates the value in yen of a given value in euros.

# 📝 Instructions:
Using the two functions available, calculate the value of 137 dollars in yen.

# 💡 Hint
Working backwards, our expected value is in yen. Our available function euroToYen will provide that, and to get to euro we will use the available function dollarToEuro.

# `08` Function parameters

You can specify as many parameters as you want in a function. 

As a developer, you are going to find functions with even 6 or 7 parameters all the time. 

The names of the parameters don't matter, but you have to be **as explicit as you can** because these names will give clues to the other developers (or yourself in the future) about what is each parameter about.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please write the `render_person` function required to print a string like the following:

```text
Bob is a 23 years old male born in 05/22/1983 with green eyes
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ You have to do some string concatenation and return that string.

+ Also, you can Google "how to insert variables into a string python".

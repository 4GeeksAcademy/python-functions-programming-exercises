# `04` Calling a function


Functions are blocks of code that you save to be (re)used later that specific fragment of code has a predefined purpose and it does a defined task. A function could receive some or no parameters to be able to execute and must always return.
=======


For example: a function that calculates the area of a square will be something like this:

```js
function calculateArea(length, edge)
{
    return length * edge
}
```


=======

If you want to use that function to calculate the area of a square with
=======



```
length = 3
edge = 6
```


=======


You need to do something like this:
```js
let squareArea = calculateArea(3,6)
```
The value of squareArea will be set to 18"





Exercise:
=======
# 📝 Instructions:


   Create a new variable named squareArea for each new iteration of the calculateArea function using the figure dimensions, for example for the first figure,
   ```js
let squareArea1 = calculateArea(3,6)
```
   For the Second figure,
   ```js
   let squareArea2 = functionCall(x,y)
   ```

# 💡 Hint:


Call the `squareArea` function 3 times, one per each square, passing the length and edge of each square.
